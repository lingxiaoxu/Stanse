# .gcloudignore - Controls which files are uploaded to Cloud Build
# SECURITY: Inherit .gitignore rules to prevent uploading sensitive files (API keys, etc.)

# Additional files to exclude from Cloud Build

# Build artifacts (will be rebuilt in Docker)

# CRITICAL: Override .gitignore to INCLUDE Cargo.lock for reproducible builds
# This is safe because Cargo.lock doesn't contain API keys, only dependency versions
